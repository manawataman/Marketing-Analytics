Marketing Analytics: Forecasting revenue for Google merchandise store (GStore)

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. 
As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

In this project, we were challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold)
customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes 
and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data
